# **🎓 EduQuiz: The Open-Source Interactive Learning Platform** {#eduquiz-the-open-source-interactive-learning-platform}

## **🚀 Mission Statement** {#mission-statement}

Welcome to **EduQuiz**! Our mission is to empower educators worldwide by
providing a **completely free, open-source, and highly interactive
learning platform** that rivals the functionality of popular tools like
Kahoot!, but without any subscription barriers. We firmly believe that
access to engaging educational technology should be universal, fostering
dynamic classroom environments and making learning fun for students
everywhere, regardless of their school\'s budget.

EduQuiz is built by teachers, for teachers, with the invaluable support
of a passionate global community. We are committed to creating a
sustainable, community-driven ecosystem where innovation in education
thrives without financial constraints, ensuring high-quality tools are
available to all.

## **✨ Features** {#features}

EduQuiz is designed to be intuitive, powerful, and flexible, catering to
the diverse needs of modern classrooms. Here\'s what we envision and are
actively building:

- **Interactive Quizzes:** Create engaging multiple-choice, true/false,
  > and open-ended questions with rich media support.

- **Real-time Participation:** Students can effortlessly join games
  > using a simple game code from any web-enabled device (smartphones,
  > tablets, laptops, desktops).

- **Live Leaderboards:** Foster healthy competition and provide instant
  > feedback with dynamic, real-time rankings.

- **Customizable Content:** Educators can easily create, save, edit, and
  > share their own quizzes, tailoring content to specific curricula.

- **Collaborative Question Bank:** A growing, community-driven
  > repository of quizzes and questions, allowing teachers to share and
  > discover content.

- **Performance Reporting & Analytics (Planned):** Robust tools to track
  > student performance, identify learning gaps, and inform
  > instructional strategies.

- **Accessibility First Design:** Developed with inclusivity in mind,
  > ensuring the platform is usable and beneficial for all learners,
  > including those with diverse needs.

- **Multi-language Support (Planned):** To serve and support our global
  > community of educators and students by offering the platform in
  > multiple languages.

## **💡 Why Open Source?** {#why-open-source}

Our commitment to an open-source model is fundamental to the EduQuiz
vision, driven by several core principles:

1.  **Universal Accessibility:** Ensures the platform remains
    > perpetually free and accessible to every teacher and student,
    > eliminating financial barriers to educational technology.

2.  **Transparency and Trust:** The entire codebase is open for public
    > inspection, fostering trust and allowing anyone to understand the
    > platform\'s functionality and security.

3.  **Community-Driven Innovation:** We believe the most impactful
    > innovations arise from diverse perspectives. Open source empowers
    > educators, developers, and designers worldwide to contribute,
    > suggest features, and collectively enhance the platform.

4.  **Flexibility and Customization:** Educational institutions or
    > individual developers have the freedom to fork the project,
    > customize it to their specific requirements, or seamlessly
    > integrate it with existing learning management systems.

5.  **Long-term Sustainability:** By operating without a subscription
    > model, EduQuiz\'s longevity is secured through community support
    > and collaborative contributions, rather than being subject to
    > fluctuating market demands.

## **💻 Technologies Used** {#technologies-used}

EduQuiz is built using a modern and robust technology stack, ensuring
scalability, performance, and ease of development:

- **Frontend:** React.js (with functional components and hooks),
  > Tailwind CSS for styling.

- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js (or similar, e.g., Python/Flask,
  > Ruby on Rails)

- **Database:** Firestore (for real-time data synchronization and
  > scalability)

- **Real-time Communication:** WebSockets (e.g., Socket.IO) for live
  > game interactions.

- **Deployment:** (e.g., Vercel, Netlify for frontend; Render, Heroku
  > for backend)

*(Note: This section is a placeholder and should be updated with your
actual tech stack as development progresses.)*

## **🏁 Getting Started** {#getting-started}

To get a local copy of EduQuiz up and running on your development
machine, follow these detailed instructions.

### **Prerequisites**

Ensure you have the following software installed:

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)

- npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn

- Git

### **Installation Steps**

1.  **Clone the Repository:**  
    > git clone https://github.com/RA-L-PH/eduquiz.git

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**  
    > cd eduquiz

3.  **Install Dependencies:**

    - **For the Frontend (React):**  
      > cd frontend \# Assuming your frontend code is in a \'frontend\'
      > directory  
      > npm install \# or yarn install

    - **For the Backend (Node.js):**  
      > cd backend \# Assuming your backend code is in a \'backend\'
      > directory  
      > npm install \# or yarn install

4.  Configure Environment Variables:  
    > Create a .env file in both your frontend and backend directories
    > (if applicable) and add necessary environment variables, such as
    > API keys, database connection strings, etc.

    - Example .env (backend):  
      > PORT=5000  
      > FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key  
      > \# \... other backend specific variables

    - Example .env (frontend):  
      > REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000  
      > \# \... other frontend specific variables

5.  **Run the Application:**

    - **Start the Backend Server:**  
      > cd backend  
      > npm start \# or node server.js, depending on your setup

    - **Start the Frontend Development Server:**  
      > cd frontend  
      > npm start

The application should now be running locally, typically accessible via
http://localhost:3000 (for the frontend).
